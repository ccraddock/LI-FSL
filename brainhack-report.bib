abstract = "Various methods have been proposed to calculate a lateralization index (LI) on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Most of them are either based on the extent of the activated brain region (i.e., the number of \u201cactive\u201d voxels) or the magnitude of the fMRI signal change. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of various variants of these approaches and to identify the one that yields the most robust and reproducible results. Robustness was assessed by evaluating the dependence on arbitrary external parameters, reproducibility was assessed by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. \{LIs\} based on active voxels counts at one single fixed statistical threshold as well as \{LIs\} based on unthresholded signal intensity changes (i.e., based on all voxels in a region of interest) yielded neither robust nor reproducible laterality results. Instead, the lateralization of a cognitive function was best described by \u201cthresholded\u201d signal intensity changes where the activity measure was based on signal intensity changes in those voxels in a region of interest that exceeded a predefined activation level. However, not all other approaches should be discarded completely since they have their own specific application fields. First, \{LIs\} based on active voxel counts in the form of p-value-dependent lateralization plots (LI = LI(p)) can be used as a straightforward measure to describe hemispheric dominance. Second, \{LIs\} based on active voxel counts at variable thresholds (standardized by the total number of active voxels) are a good alternative for big regions of interest since \{LIs\} based on signal intensity changes are restricted to small ROIs.

abstract = "A lateralization index (LI) is commonly computed to describe the asymmetry of activation as detectable by various functional imaging techniques, particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this article, we examine and compare different approaches that have been used in the past. For illustration purposes, 100 synthetic datasets and real fMRI-data from 12 subjects were evaluated. As shown before, the calculation of a lateralization index suffers from a number of drawbacks, namely vulnerability to statistical outliers, data sparsity, thresholding effects and lack of taking into account regional variability of activation. Optional processing steps investigated here seem to increase reliability of the such-calculated indices. To allow a more standardized, reproducible and accessible evaluation of laterality effects, current and new approaches have been implemented in a versatile toolbox running within the spm2 or spm5 software environment.
